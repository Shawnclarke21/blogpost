## how to run and install
to run and install this it can be done two ways you can have access to my github repo clone it onto your local device and run it from there or you can take the link to the git hub page to run the program. when clicking the link you will be redirected to the website where you will be met with comments that were already created and be able to sign up and log in if you arent logged in you can view material but you wont be able to post or interact with posts.

## credits

i used youtube tutorials to help set up the basic structure
chatgpt to figure out errors and how to fix them
shawn clarke did the coding
and i used google and docs to write out the code 

## what was learned
in this project i was able to learn how to create login log out and sign up functions using javascript and how to hash passwords using dotenv i was also able to learn how to keep and maintain a well structured layout using handlebars and work on routing. i was also able to learn how manage my work space a bit better by creating filed and folders at the start so i dont get cluttered later on. some issues i ran into was a lot of syntax errors and misspelling causing routing to not work and kept forgetting to write certain files such as the server js and .env so i kept having errors when trying to run the code. unforunatly i wasnt able to get the code to display on screen and i wasnt able to get it to run properly so in the future i will continue to work on this and see where i can take it.
